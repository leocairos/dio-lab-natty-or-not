Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Training Project Challenge

Lab "Natural or Fake Natty? How to Win in the Age of Generative AI!"


## üìí Description

Application developed with Next JS to display the Top 20 cryptocurrencies (by marketcap) excluding stable coins.

## ü§ñ Technologies Used

- Generative AI **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)** to create the application and ebook with technologies used;
- Generative AI **[Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai)** to create the visual art logo;

## üßê Creation Process

I used **ChatGPT** to create the project, using the following prompt:
 - act as a frontend developer
 - Create an app in Next JS that displays the 20 cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap on its home page. This list cannot contain stable coins. The list must have: symbol, name, current price, price variation in the last 24 and last 7 days. Use the dark theme.

And in the same conversation, I asked to generate an e-book for beginners in development. Describing the technologies used and the step-by-step process.

I used **Leonardo AI** to create a logo for the project. I used the following prompt:
- create an image for a website that displays information about the cryptocurrency market. The name of the website is Coin Market View
